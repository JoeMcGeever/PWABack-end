# REST Web API Template

This code provides a working template for the development of modern REST APIs connecting to a MySQL database.

It only runs on Codio boxes.

To install, run the following command from inside the Codio box:

```
$ curl -sL https://bit.ly/35UD7Hv | sudo -E bash -
```

> Note this will delete ALL the existing content from your Codio Box.
